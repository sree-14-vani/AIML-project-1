TITLE : MUSIC GENRE CLASSIFICATION
I am developing a Music Genre Classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The GTZAN dataset has been preprocessed by extracting MFCC features with Librosa and encoding labels for model training. A CNN model was built and trained in Keras to classify audio files into 10 different music genres. The model achieved good accuracy on the validation set.
Currently, I am working on a script to upload audio files and predict their genres along with confidence scores. I am also adding spectrogram visualizations to help interpret the predictions. The next step is to deploy the system into a Streamlit web app for user-friendly interaction.
